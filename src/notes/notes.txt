Password Manager Flow/Ideas:

1. Site goes to home page with high level information / promotional information
2. There is an about page with an explanation of the app, and also a link to socials
3. There is a login button that will grant access to password list of that user
4. There will be a account/profile details page where users can edit/update their profile
5. There is a passwords page
6. The passwords page is searchable
7. DATA STORAGE: Data storage needs encryption
8. clicking on a password "element" will take you to a page dedicated to that account
9. The specific account page will contain: Username, email used, previous passwords
10. In the passwords page there is a "+" button for creating a new entry
11. This create new should also be accessible from the side (maybe?)
12. DATA STORAGE: the property names should never be obvious
13. The login page needs an account recovery
14. There should be a "help" element in the nav, which brings down a menu when hovered over
15. The help dropdown will have options for account recovery

BEM (https://en.bem.info/methodology/naming-convention/)

SMACSS (https://smacss.com/) - can't use, clashes with BEM

Accessibility Notes:
aria-label - eg: for links, say what will happen when you click (aria-label="view details for X priced at X")

useParams

const params = useParams() // grabs the params of the url
